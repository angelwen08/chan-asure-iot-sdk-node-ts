    summary: >-
      The allocation policy of this individual enrollment. This policy overrides
      the tenant-level allocation policy.

      - 'hashed': Linked IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned
      to them.

      - 'geoLatency':  Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest
      latency to the device.If multiple linked IoT hubs would provide the same
      lowest latency, the provisioning service hashes devices across those hubs.

      - 'static' : Specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list
      takes priority over the service-level allocation policy.

      - 'custom': Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub based on your own custom
      logic. The provisioning service passes information about the device to the
      logic, and the logic returns the desired IoT hub as well as the desired
      initial configuration. We recommend using Azure Functions to host your
      logic.
